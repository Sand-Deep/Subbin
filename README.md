# Subbin


These modules are a implementation of the hidden Markov model described in this paper:
State selective detection of hyperfine qubits
http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/48/7/075101

The aim of this code is to determine if an ion fluorescing in an ion trap was initially bright or dark given the photons that we collect and their temporal distribution.
