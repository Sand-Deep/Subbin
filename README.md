# Subbin

These modules are a implemetation of the hidden markov model described in this paper:
State selective detection of hyperfine qubits
http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/48/7/075101

The aim of this code is to determine if an ion flouresicing in an ion trap was initially bright or dark given the photons that we collect and their temporal distribution.


For a background on the scientific methedology used to design this software see subbin_background.pdf
